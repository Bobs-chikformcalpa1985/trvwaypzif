Just came out of Picture This and wow, my head’s spinning like a cat chasing its own tail. I mean, seriously, you ever just sit down and feel like the butt of somebody's cosmic joke? Popcorn's everywhere, and I think some of it got stuck in my hoodie. Ugh. Felt like I was sitting on rocks. Why are theater seats so... hard? Anyway, the  . 

It's like, halfway through, I forgot if I was in reality or some kind of warped mirror — you know? Like when they zoomed in on that painting and the colors just spilled off-screen, like they were gonna invade the theater and you’d have to swim your way out in brushstrokes and chaos. 

> At some point, a dude behind me sneezed so loud I swear the characters on screen ducked. That or I was just so sucked in it felt that real. Honestly, couldn't tell you if I even blinked for the last half hour. Someone should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , no, scratch that, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in all its messy, shaky glory.

The plot — can you even call it that? More like a blown-apart jigsaw puzzle. One scene they’re at a dance competition, next they’re... I don’t know, philosophizing in a swamp? It made as much sense as a chocolate teapot. But there’s something magnetic in that madness.

Had this moment where I think I dropped my phone, right as the main character was about to confess something big. Lost it in popcorn. Next thing, she’s yelling at a fish tank. Why? Couldn't tell you, but I felt that yell deep in my bones, reverberating like one of those oversized bass drums. Relatable. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the catharsis, if nothing else.

The soundtrack, man, it felt like a DJ was having a mental breakdown, spinning records of screams and whispers. Oddly haunting. Kind of like if Radiohead and your drunk uncle decided to form a band — disjointed but captivating.

And that ending, what even was that? Walked out more confused than a cat in a mirror maze. Gonna need a strong drink and maybe a week to digest. Was it genius or just plain absurd? Guess it just depends if the person 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨's got their feet on the ground or their head in the clouds.
